## OBSERVATIONS
1.In our project,only 1 city was taken into consideration for weather prediction in that city.<br>
2.The dataset was taken from [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/).<br>
3.It contained the records of weather conditions of 2018 upto Feb of 2019.<br>
4.The **Linear Regression** model was found to be more efficient with an accuracy of 94.7%.<br>

## FUTURE WORK 1
1.Create a dataset containing the records of 2 or more neighbouring cities, so that the prediction is more accurate.<br>
2.Use ANN(Deep Learning) for more accurate prediction.<br>

## FUTURE WORK 2
1.Use satellites for remote monitoring of weather conditions in the cities.<br>
2.Take realtime data as input to the model instead of feeding it manually.<br>
3.This method gives more accurate prediction.
