# KNOW-I PROJECT
## WEATHER PREDICTION SYSTEM
The objective of this project is to forecast weather condition based on the previous days weather.For experiment, we consider only temperature, windspeed and dew point as parameters. The dataset contains the above mentioned parameters. The model is trained using linear regression and Naive Bayesian classification algorithm.
The machine learning model is expected to be 94% accurate.<br>
## IMPLEMENTATION:
Use of Django framework to develop the website. The procedure involves collecting the datasets of temperature , windspeed,humidity, dew point and train the model using the datasets. If the user enters the three parameters they will get the predicted value of temparature in fahrenheit.<br>

## JUSTIFICATION:
Out of all the algorithms implemented (Linear regression,Random forest regressor and Gradient boosting regressor), Linear regression is found to be the most efficient and accurate algorithm to predict weather.<br>
Linear regression attempts to fit a straight hyperplane to the dataset that is closest to all data points. It is most suitable when there are linear relationships between the variables in the dataset.
### Advantages
Quick to compute and can be updated easily with new data.<br>
Relatively easy to understand and explain.<br>
Regularization techniques can be used to prevent overfitting.<br>
