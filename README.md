# Know-I-project
weather prediction
The objective of this project is to forecast weather condition based on the previous days weather.For experiment, we consider only temperature, humidity and dew point as parameters. The dataset contains the above mentioned parameters. The model is trained using linear regression and Naive Bayesian classification algorithm.
The machine learning model is expected to be 90% accurate.
IMPLEMENTATION:
Use of Django framework to develop the website. The procedure involves collecting the datasets of temperature , humidity , dew point and train the model using the datasets. Store the values which are predicted using model into the database. The stored predicted value can be used as training datasets for further prediction to improve the accuracy rate.
